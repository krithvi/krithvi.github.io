      <h1>Bananas</h1>
<p>14 Nov 2020 - kavya</p>

<p>A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds
of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</p>
<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called &quot;plantains&quot;,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.</p>
